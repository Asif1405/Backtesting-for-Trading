# Backtesting-for-Trading

### Overview:
In this project, I built a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and i implemented it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. I also used performance attribution to identify the major drivers of the portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL)

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
